# Neo-Processor
Neo-Processor is an alternative optimization heuristic designed for use with FIA BioSum projects (biosum.info). Neo-Processor is Python based and includes both a forward-reaching optimal bucking module for processing cut trees and a landscape level heuristic utilizing a modified Great Deluge algorithm.

Full program documentation can be found in NPDoc.pdf

Python scripts and necessary parameter files can be found in NeoProcessor.zip

Sample prescription inputs can be found in their individual zip files.

Neo-Processor was designed for use with cut-to-length harvesting systems in the Klamath Basin and WILL NOT provide valid outputs for other harvest systems or regions without significant modifications.
